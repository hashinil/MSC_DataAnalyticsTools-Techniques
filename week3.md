Binomial distribution:
- counting success in a fixed number of trials
- A basketball player makes 80% of her free throws. If she takes 5 shots, what’s the probability she makes exactly 4?
- Number of trials n = 5
- Probability of success p = 0.8
- Number of successes k = 4
- Answer: The probability she makes exactly 4 shots is 0.4096 or 40.96%

Poisson distribution:
- counting events in a fixed amount of time or space.
- A website gets an average of 3 hits per minute. What’s the probability it gets exactly 2 hits in a minute?
